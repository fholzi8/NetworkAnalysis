# libebpfflow
Traffic visibility library based on eBPF

### Introduction
libebpfflow is a traffic visibility library based on eBPF able to compute network flows. It can be used to:
* enable network visibility
* create a packet-less network probe
* inspect host and container communications for different container runtimes

### Main features
* Ability to inspect TCP and UDP traffic
* Container visibility
* TCP latency computation
* Process and user visibility

### Supported Languages
* Golang
* C/C++
 
### Requirements
You need a modern eBPF-enabled Linux distribution.

On Ubuntu 16.04/18.04 LTS you can install the prerequisites (we assume that the compiler is already installed) as follows:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libbpfcc-dev
```

### Build
Library only
```sh
$ make libebpfflow.a
```
Library and ebpflowexport
```sh
$ make
```
Go testing tool
```sh
make go_ebpflowexport
```

### Testing
The library comes with two different tools: *ebpflowexport* and *go\_ebpflowexport*. In the _Build_ section is reported how to build the tools. Although both tools were developed to show potential library usage and to provide guidance on how to use the library, *ebpflowexport* displays all the information provided by *libebpfflow* and provides some options for filtering flow events while *go\_ebpflowexport* displays only basic information concerning events.
```sh
$ sudo ./ebpflowexport -h
ebpflowexport: Traffic visibility tool based on libebpfflow. By default all events will be shown 
Usage: ebpflow [ OPTIONS ] 
   -h, --help      display this message 
   -t, --tcp       TCP events 
   -u, --udp       UDP events 
   -i, --in        incoming events (i.e. TCP accept and UDP receive) 
   -o, --on        outgoing events (i.e. TCP connect and UDP send) 
   -r, --retr      retransmissions events 
   -c, --tcpclose  TCP close events 
   -d, --docker    gather additional information concerning containers (default: enabled)
   -v, --verbose   vebose formatting (default: every event is shown) 
Note: please run as root 
```
What follows is a demostration of the execution of *ebpflowexport* in a system where both minikube with containerd as runtime and docker containers are running at the same time.
```sh
$ sudo ./ebpflowexport -tio

A basic example of usage in c++ can be found in the directory */examples* whereas for the Go language the example provided is the one in */go/ebpf_flow.go*. More details on how to use the library you can be found in the [ntopng](https://github.com/ntop/ntopng) code or by inspecting the code of the tool ebpflowexport application.

### Export eBPF Information to ntopng
Supposing to start both ebpflowexport and ntopng on the same host do

- ntopng -i tcp://127.0.0.1:1234
- ebpflowexport -z tcp://127.0.0.1:1234


### Start as a Docker container
To use ebpflowexport as a Docker container first you have to build the tool. Once the tool has been built, build the docker image from the project root:
```sh
$ docker build -t ebpflowexport .
```
The container can then be run
```sh
$ docker run -it --rm --privileged \
  -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro \
  -v /usr/src:/usr/src:ro \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  -v /sys/kernel/debug:/sys/kernel/debug \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /snap/bin/microk8s.ctr:/snap/bin/microk8s.ctr \ 
  ebpflowexport
```

### Open Issues
While the library is already usable in production, we plan to add some additional features including:
* Implement periodic flow stats exports including bytes/packets/retransmissions
