Licenses
========

nEdge is shipped with two different licenses:

- **nEdge Pro**: provides full monitoring capabilities, but only *bridge mode* support.
  Protocol/category policies can be set, along with bandwidth limits and quotas.
  It does *not* provide *routing mode*.

- **nEdge Enterprise**: provides all the features of the *nEdge* version plus the
  *routing mode*, with the possibility to load balance or failover multiple gateways.
