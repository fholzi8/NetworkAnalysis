In order to avoid redis fillup all the available memory please set some memory limit in /etc/redis.conf

It is a good idea to setup some upper limits such as:

maxmemory 300mb
maxmemory-policy volatile-lru

Of course you need to set these values according to your environment, so your mileage may vary.
